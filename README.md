# Welcome to Enract

Enract is a free Latin text encryption tool designed to encrypt messages and documents in order to protect the privacy of the users communicating. It uses basic encryption methods to cipher your input, which can then be deciphered by anyone having access to your encryption alphabet. This alphabet can be compared to a key, is stored in an enract file and contains the system behind the encryption used. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt the wanted text, and then to be sent to anyone you wish to communicate with, to allow them to do the same. They can be open for everyone or protected using a passcode. The software can generate as many alphabets as needed, and can add external ones if you wish to use a pre-generated one.
